# Python

Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language))

# Trivia

*  Conceived in 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands.
*  The language is named after one of Guido’s favourite programs “Monty Pythons Flying Circus”, a classic British comedy sketch show originally running from 1969 to 1974.

# Why python is popular?

* Easy to learn.
* Ability to run on (almost) any operating system, especially on Linux, Windows, MacOS.
* Ability to be used as a scripting language - finds usage in developing Web applications.
* Huge collection of libraries created for the use in scientific community, e.g. [Numpy](https://numpy.org/), [SciPy](https://scipy.org/) etc. Finds usage in Data Science, Machine Learning community.
* It's Free!!!!!

What shall you learn?

Firstly, you will learn about basics of python programming. Next, we shall move on to solving linear as well as non linear systems, interpolation and polynomial approximation techniques, numerical differentiation and integration techniques, solution methods for ordinary and partial differential equations etc. We shall choose problems from different areas of physics. Eventually, we shall also learn about data visualization.
